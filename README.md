📊 Interactive Sales Dashboard with Streamlit - Day 21
This project is part of my 30-Day Coding Challenge with my coding partner, Swara Gharat. For Day 21, we built an interactive sales dashboard using Python and the Streamlit library to visualize and analyze superstore sales data.

The application allows users to filter a large dataset by region and product category and instantly see the updated metrics and charts. It's a demonstration of how to turn a static spreadsheet into a dynamic and insightful web-based tool.

🚀 Key Features
Interactive Sidebar Filters: Dynamically filter the entire dashboard by Region and Category.

Live KPI Cards: At-a-glance metrics for Total Sales, Total Profit, and Average Sale Value that update based on filters.

Dynamic Visualizations:

A horizontal bar chart showing Sales by Product Sub-Category.

A pie chart illustrating the proportion of Sales by Region.

Expandable Data Table: View the raw, filtered data in a clean, scrollable table.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.

Streamlit: For building and running the interactive web application.

Pandas: For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.

Plotly Express: For creating beautiful and interactive charts.
